It is well documented that the accuracy of data comparisons is worse for 3D charts, but these studies are almost entirely focused on 2D projections. In this week's meeting, you will have the opportunity to explore the use of truly three-dimensional charts, as well as more realistic 3D renderings using WebGL and traditional two-dimensional charts. We'll discuss the Cleveland & McGill study and the challenges of conducting studies that require participants to use both physical and virtual data displays. If you have the ability to attend this meeting in person, you will want to do so!
