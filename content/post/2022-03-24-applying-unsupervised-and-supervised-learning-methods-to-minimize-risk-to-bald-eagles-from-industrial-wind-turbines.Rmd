In this talk I describe a collaboration with research wildlife biologists and statisticians to analyze over 2 million data points collected from GPS telemetry devices attached to bald eagles. My research project involved two phases: unsupervised learning, and supervised learning.  The intent of this project was to understand land types where bald eagles might be at greater risk of collision with industrial wind turbines to inform placement of wind farms.
