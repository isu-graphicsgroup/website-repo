This week are going to have a global crossover shared meeting, with Iowa/Nebraska Graphics Group and Australian NUMBATs, with pizza! We are going to talk about favorite R packages, hidden gems, love/hate packages, and our own package contributions. It is a chance to meet like-minded people on the other side of the globe. In preparation, please tell us about your package stories (link to survey sent to Denise)
