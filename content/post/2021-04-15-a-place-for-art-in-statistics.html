<p>Most people see math and art as two parts of the brain, one as logical one as emotional. The goal of art is to tell a story in a glance, isn’t that the same goal of a data visualization? Here we will take a look at the line between the left brain and the right brain in Data Art and discuss the functionality of adding emotion to the logic.</p>
