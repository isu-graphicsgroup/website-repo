<p>When working on a project, sometimes it is necessary to use different programming languages to accomplish a task. The <code>Reticulate</code> Package in R creates a R interface to Python, allowing for R and Python to be used smoothly with each other. This presentation will give a brief overview of the <code>Reticulate</code> Package. As an example of the use of this package, I will present a Shiny application that I have been developing, and the steps I took in order to get Python working within the app. This Shiny App will be used to create experimental designs for a farmer’s field based on their specific field conditions (e.g. type of treatment, size of field, etc), where the creation of this design happens in both R and Python.</p>
