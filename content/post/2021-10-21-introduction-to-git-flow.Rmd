Having a standard workflow to follow is helpful to manage a complicated project, especially when multiple developers are involved. git flow provides git users with useful commands for following one such workflow. In this presentation, I will introduce a standard workflow for git users, provide intuition, give a short demo using basic commands of git flow, and a discussion on other kinds of workflow in the workspace. I will also talk about some concepts related to git (add, commit, pull, push, merge, branch, etc.)  Everyone interested in git, is welcome to join. 

The slides for the talk can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15KQBNdQEL-te9IMjBJV9EQwiX1Xaj-agJL_MySfDU2s/edit?usp=sharing) [github](https://github.com/willju-wangqian/will-gitflow-demo)
