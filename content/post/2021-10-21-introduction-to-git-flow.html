<p>Having a standard workflow to follow is helpful to manage a complicated project, especially when multiple developers are involved. git flow provides git users with useful commands for following one such workflow. In this presentation, I will introduce a standard workflow for git users, provide intuition, give a short demo using basic commands of git flow, and a discussion on other kinds of workflow in the workspace. I will also talk about some concepts related to git (add, commit, pull, push, merge, branch, etc.) Everyone interested in git, is welcome to join.</p>
