If you have built a Shiny app, you have some familiarity with the concept of reactivity. For the next two graphics-groups, we’ll talk about two alternatives to Shiny which also use reactivity: 

-	Dash, using Python
-	Observable, using JavaScript

As examples, we’ll talk about how you can build the “same” app using all three tools. For the first session, we’ll discuss Shiny and Dash.

Here’s a reference I’m working on: https://ijlyttle.github.io/reactivity-three-ways-quarto/. If you like, you can have a read through the “Shiny” chapter to set the stage. We’ll focus on the “Python” chapter this Thursday.

As well, I have built an RStudio Cloud project that ***you*** can use on Thursday to try out the Dash app – all you would need to do is sign up for the ***free*** level of RStudio Cloud: https://rstudio.cloud/plans/free.
