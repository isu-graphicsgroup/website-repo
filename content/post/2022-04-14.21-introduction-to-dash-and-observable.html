<p>If you have built a Shiny app, you have some familiarity with the concept of reactivity. For the next two graphics-groups, we’ll talk about two alternatives to Shiny which also use reactivity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dash, using Python</li>
<li>Observable, using JavaScript</li>
</ul>
<p>As examples, we’ll talk about how you can build the “same” app using all three tools. For the first session, we’ll discuss Shiny and Dash.</p>
<p>Here’s a reference I’m working on: <a href="https://ijlyttle.github.io/reactivity-three-ways-quarto/" class="uri">https://ijlyttle.github.io/reactivity-three-ways-quarto/</a>. If you like, you can have a read through the “Shiny” chapter to set the stage. We’ll focus on the “Python” chapter this Thursday.</p>
<p>As well, I have built an RStudio Cloud project that <strong><em>you</em></strong> can use on Thursday to try out the Dash app – all you would need to do is sign up for the <strong><em>free</em></strong> level of RStudio Cloud: <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/plans/free" class="uri">https://rstudio.cloud/plans/free</a>.</p>
