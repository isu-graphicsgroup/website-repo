<p>In the last couple years, the Tidyverse team has made a series of informative presentations, giving practical advice on how to “deal with” tidy evaluation: the framework used for non-standard evaluation in the Tidyverse. This interactive tutorial, available at <a href="http://ijlyttle.shinyapps.io/tidyeval/" class="uri">http://ijlyttle.shinyapps.io/tidyeval/</a>, has been reworked to focus on this practical advice: how to write functions for (1) Shiny apps, and (2) interactive use. The tutorial includes videos of the Tidyverse team’s presentations – which you might find interesting to watch in advance (or later). During the Graphics Group session, we will go through as much of the tutorial as time will permit.</p>
